* [Playing around with my spotify data!](https://hl105.github.io/spotify-diary/)
* Jupyter notebook contains python code for users to create their own website with their downloaded Spotify data

## About
First full website page project. Learned to use:
- localStorage for collecting user data and resetting page (javascript)
- use image file name (collected from Python script) to fill in page text (javascript)
- display: flex / overlay / other advanced css content (html/css)


### Future Steps
- learn how to use React / node.js and replace localStorage
- extend page so that users can drop in their spotify data folder and it'll automatically fill in the page
